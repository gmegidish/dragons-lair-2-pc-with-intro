# Dragon's Lair II Timewarp PC with Intro

##### Context

In August of 2022, Indie Retro News ran this post: [Dragon's Lair II Time Warp: Amiga Intro Animation redone frame by frame in Personal Paint by Hache](https://www.indieretronews.com/2022/07/dragons-lair-ii-time-warp-amiga-intro.html)

I immediately emailed Hache about it, asking if I could get the original files so we can release a new version of the DOS game with his
intro. He was very excited and sent me the .gif file.

Hache is Hern√°n Beroldo, artist from Argentina. And his work made this possible. You can reach Hache at hacheberoldo at gmail dot com.

You can see how it runs on my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/GilMegidish/posts/pfbid02AdpY4naXw5XuzqZefsShzKMNmEeTSYxN3Li7UN5KwL3k4A8WvuKFmgB8wxBEUKFCl

##### Getting started

Clone this repo, run `make` to build the .com file, and `make run` to launch it with dosbox-x on your mac.

##### Technical details

The code in this current state is:

1. Works only on emulators --- it would be TOO slow to load these frames uncompressed on a real hdd
2. The conversion was done from laserdisc, on a PAL Amiga. Original video is 320x256x32 (5 bitplanes). However, PC doesn't support this, so 320x240x256 (unchained mode-x) is the best next thing.
3. I decided to write this in assembly, just cause it's fun
4. It's implemented using mode-x, unchained 4 planes, 2 pages with page flipping. Single palette for entire animation.
5. No compression, no audio, no timing at the moment. Just added 6 vsyncs between frames.
